# Open Reading Frame Locator

This program finds open reading frames (ORFs) in a DNA sequence. An Open Reading Frame begins with the "ATG" start codon and ends with one of the three stop codons: "TAG", "TGA", or "TAA".

It returns the locations of the start and stop codon along with the length in nucleotides of the ORF. 

You may upload a .FASTA or .txt file of a nucleotide sequence to determine the amount of ORFs. 

For this example, I have used the SARS-CoV-2 viral sequence from NCBI (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/NC_045512).
